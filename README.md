The challenge is divided into two task:
 
    1. Application tests
    2. API Tests 

 - A Rest API Automation framework has been created from scratch in order to implement above two scenarios.

## Tech Stack Used for the Project 

 - Java (programming language used)
 - Maven
 - Rest Assured - API Automation Framework
 - TestNG (unit test framework)
 - Extent Report (Reporting)

   or command line and type java --version. 
 - Download Eclipse or Intellij as an IDE in order to run the      program.
 - Please visit Eclipse Market Place in order to download TestNG as a plugin before running the test

 
## Steps to run the project on your local 

 - Ensure Pre-requisites are all set 
 - Download the project from github repository
 - Open Eclipse IDE 
 - Click on Import and import exisiting maven project 
 - There are two ways to run the project after build is complete: 
    - Right click on testng.xml file, click on Run As -> TestNG Suite
    - Right Click on individual classes and run the project in order to view the rests. 
 - Once you run the tests using testng.xml a html test report is generated under "test-output" folder by name ScratchPayAPIAutomation.html. Please open it in order to view the results.
